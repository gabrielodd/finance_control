## Dependencies

Here's a summary of key dependencies used in the project:

- **MySQL2** (for MySQL database integration)
- **Devise** (user authentication)
- **Chartkick** (for generating charts in reports)
- **Delayed Job Active Record** (for background job processing)

## Database Structure

The database structure is defined as follows:

- **categoria**: Stores categories created by the user. Each category belongs to a user.
- **despesas**: Stores expenses with fields for description, value, date, and whether it's a recurring expense. Each expense is associated with a category and a user.
- **user_configurations**: Stores user-specific settings like `locale` and `panel_color`.
- **users**: Stores user authentication data and user type (admin or regular user).

Hereâ€™s an example schema for each table:

```ruby
create_table "categoria" do |t|
  t.string "name"
  t.text "description"
  t.bigint "user_id"
end

create_table "despesas" do |t|
  t.string "descricao"
  t.decimal "valor", precision: 15, scale: 2
  t.date "date"
  t.boolean "repeating"
  t.bigint "categoria_id"
  t.bigint "user_id"
end

create_table "user_configurations" do |t|
  t.string "locale"
  t.bigint "user_id"
  t.string "panel_color"
end

create_table "users" do |t|
  t.string "email", null: false
  t.string "encrypted_password", null: false
  t.boolean "admin", default: false
end
```
